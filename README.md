Project Overview
This is a simple web-app built with React and Redux that demonstrates the 'Would You Rather' game. A user is asked to select a username and then answer "would you rather" questions where he/she must select between two options. After selecting an option, the poll's result (how others voted) is shown. You may also create your own questions, as well as view the game's Leaderboard.
